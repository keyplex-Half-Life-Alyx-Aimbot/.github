## 🧠 What Exactly Is the Alyx Aimbot?

This ain’t your typical “VR aim assist.” We’re talking:

* **Full target acquisition** – Auto-lock onto enemies with smooth natural movement
* **Adjustable FOV & Aim Speed** – Control how snappy or subtle your shots feel
* **Bone Targeting** – Go for head, chest, limbs — you pick
* **Triggerbot Option** – Auto-fire when your reticle hits a target
* **VR Controller Compatible** – Works seamlessly with Index, Oculus, and Vive

It’s designed to *enhance*, not break immersion. You’ll still feel in control — just with superhuman reflexes.
